Job Apply Application
----------------------

I developed a Job Apply Application Backend using C#, ASP.NET Core, Dapper, LINQ, and MySQL. The project provides a set of RESTful APIs to manage core entities including Users, Companies, Jobs, and Applications.

The backend is designed with a focus on scalability, performance, and clean architecture. For data retrieval, I implemented Dapper, leveraging its lightweight and high-performance querying capabilities. For other CRUD operations, I used Entity Framework with LINQ, ensuring code readability and faster development.

This hybrid approach of using Dapper + LINQ enabled faster project delivery, optimized query execution, and maintainable code structure.
